The Caterpillar Fair By Irene Rawnsley
Ten little caterpillars wriggled to the fair.
What did they do when they got there?
One ate potatoes,
one ate pie,
one bought a telescope to look at the sky.
One blew a trumpet,
one played guitar,
two sat together in a dodgem car.
One met an elephant,
one saw a seal
and one went riding on the whirly whirly wheel!
